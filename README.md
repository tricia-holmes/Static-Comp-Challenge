## Abstract

Hi! This is my `static solo comp` project. The goal was to build something that respects the integrity of the original design, while being able to take creative license with theme, fonts, color palette, icons, and images. I made mine into a `Pinerest` like design. I've been getting very excited for decorating for the holidays so a majority of the content was focused on different design aesthetics for the holidays <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108706408/198917516-5df70469-95fd-43bc-904b-c12a3b0341d8.gif" style="height: 45px">

## Context

- I am currently a Front End student at Turing in Mod 2. This project was our Mod 2 week 3 project and the goals were to follow a given design and to get practice in using only `HTML` and `CSS`.
